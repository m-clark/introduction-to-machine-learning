# Preface

The purpose of this document is to provide a conceptual introduction to statistical or machine learning (ML) techniques for those that would not normally be exposed to such approaches during their typical required statistical training.  <span class="emph">Machine learning</span>[^mlothername] can be described as a form of a statistics, often even utilizing well-known and familiar techniques, that has bit of a different focus than traditional analytical practice in the social sciences and other disciplines.  The key notion is that flexible, automatic approaches are used to detect patterns within the data, with a primary focus on making predictions on future data.

If one surveys the number of techniques available in ML without any context, it will surely be overwhelming in terms of the sheer number of approaches, as well as the various tweaks and variations of them.  However, the specifics of the techniques are not as important as more general concepts that would be applicable in most every ML setting, and indeed, many traditional ones as well.  While there will be examples using the R statistical environment and descriptions of a few specific approaches, the focus here is more on ideas than application[^moredata] and kept at the conceptual level as much as possible.  However, some applied examples of more common techniques will be provided in detail.

As for prerequisite knowledge, I will assume a basic familiarity with regression analyses typically presented to those in applied disciplines.  Regarding programming, none is really required to follow most of the content here, but some knowledge of R would be helpful if one wants get into the code.  Note that I won't do much explaining of the code, as I will be more concerned with getting to a result than clearly detailing the path to it.  Armed with even introductory knowledge, if there are parts of R code that are unclear, there are many resources to investigate and discover the details on one's own, which results in more learning anyway.

A final note, this document is prepared testing mostly with the Chrome and Firefox browsers on large screens.  While capable of being perused on smaller screens largely without issue, I'm far more interested in how it looks in more viable context.

[^moredata]: Indeed, there is evidence that with large enough samples many techniques converge to similar performance.
